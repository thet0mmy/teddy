Tommy's Second Editor

Hey this is my editor that I wrote in vanilla ANSI C.
I wrote it on a FreeBSD system but I am now using openSUSE for all of my stuff these days

I have uploaded it here to GitHub.
Use it as you wish, I just want some credit for it.

A binary distribution is available in case you do not have a functional C compiler available.
However it will not be up to date most of the time.
Therefore building it with GCC or CC is reccomended under all circumstances.

To build this program:
~~~
  gcc teddy.c -o teddy
  cc teddy.c -o teddy
~~~
I have not tested this program under other compilers, however it is very simple so I'm sure that it will work.
I wrote this editor in an hour and a half to two hours. I used GVim and Vim to edit the file.

If you find an issue:
  - Add an issue report to this repo.
  - Fork it if you want to fix it yourself.
  - If you fork it and a fix is made, fill a pull request

Thank you :)
