Tommy's Second Editor

Hey this is my editor that I wrote in vanilla ANSI C.
I wrote it on a FreeBSD system but I am now using openSUSE for all of my stuff these days

I have uploaded it here to GitHub.
Use it as you wish, I just want some credit for it.

A binary distribution is available in case you do not have a functional C compiler available.
However it will not be up to date most of the time.
Therefore building it with GCC or CC is reccomended under all circumstances.
